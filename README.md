# Balanced binary tree

A binary search tree is an abstract data structure consisting of nodes. Each
node can have a left and a right subtree, with the nodes on the left being
smaller and the ones on the right being greater than the parent node itself.

A binary search tree can be considered balanced if the following conditions are
met:

- The height of the left and the right subtree of the root node differ by at
    most 1.
- The left subtree is also balanced.
- The right subtree is also balanced.
